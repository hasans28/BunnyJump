# BunnyJump
A game similar to the Google Chrome dinosaur game developed in Unity for the Android platform.

The background and ground were imported from the Unity Asset Store using the package "TooCubeForest". The dimensions are optimized for any screen resolution.

The sprites for the characters and buttons were sourced from flaticon.com.
